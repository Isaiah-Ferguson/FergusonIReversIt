This app. will prompt the user to input a combination of any characters and will output the reverse of the input.
Review: Elizar Garcia, Code works beautifully. If i put in numbers they come back in reverse and the same with letters no matter what they are. The orginization of the coding is my favorite part of it. It helps me understand why putting your variable up top is important. It keeps your code looking clean and helps clear up any confusion of what has already been declared.
